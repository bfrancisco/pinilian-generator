# Why make a generator?
Traditional art forms here in the Philippines are being faded away as society progresses. Through making these kind of generators, we can preserve and still appreciate these traditonal art forms.

# How does it work?
Users can input their preferred:
  * Size (Small, Medium, Large)
  * Primary Color
  * Secondary Color
  * Generate a PNG or GIF pattern

# Last words
This is a project from my Arts class at the **Ateneo de Manila Senior High School**. Special thanks to my groupmates, **Jhoana Aguilar** and **Gwen Curativo**. 

I also give thanks to **Cisco Ortega**, my Comp Prog Coach. His **L-painter** project and **L-textiles** problem in *Codeforces* inspired us to do this project.
